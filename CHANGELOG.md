## Unreleased
- (placeholder)

## 1.0.0 - 2025-11-20
- Added configurable RFC compliance options (newlines-in-quotes opt-in, ability to disable quote parsing for speed).
- Expanded parsing helpers: culture-aware and format overloads for date/time types; enum parsing; numeric helpers across byte/short/int/long/float/decimal; timezone parsing.
- Improved UTF-8 parsing consistency and clarified allocation behavior (UTF-8 culture/format parsing decodes to UTF-16).
- Updated CI permissions for publishing test results; benchmarks now toggle RFC options for comparison.
